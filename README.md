How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How do user stories  help with this?

I interpret user needs by breaking them down into, actionable requirements that describe what the user wants to accomplish and why it matters. In the SNHU Travel project, this meant translating stakeholder goals, such as allowing users to search for destinations or view travel packages into user stories with defined acceptance criteria. As noted in my project reflection. User stories help by keeping the focus on the user's perspective, ensuring that each feature is tied to real value and can be developed in small, manageable increments.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into future development work?

I approach development iteratively, focusing on delivering small, functional pieces of a system rather than trying to build everything at once. Agile processes such as sprint planning, backlog refinement, and daily stand-ups help break work into achievable tasks and maintain alignment within the team. In my project, I saw how "the team clarified acceptance criteria,estimated effort, and completed the work within a sprint" which made development more predictable and reduced risk. Going forward, I plan to incorporate iterative development, continuous feedback, and regular retrospectives to improve both the product and the development process.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means communicating clearly, collaborating openly, and supporting the team's shared goals. In the project, I demonstrated this through emails requesting clarification, discussions with teammates, and coordination across roles. As I wrote, "These interactions encouraged collaboration by creating transparency and ensuring everyone had the information needed to move forward." A good team member removes blockers, respects others' contributions, participates consistently in Scrum events, and helps maintain a positive, productive environment.
